How to use ?

Rename the folder named "YourFileName" to whatever you want

Open OpenIV 
-Enable Edit mod -Navigate to customrpf.rpf (If you do not have the file path it is included with your download the folder is named mods, drop it in your GTA Directory) 
FILE PATH:OpenIV > GTA V > mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks > custompath >dlc.rpf > x64 > levels > gta5 > customrpf.rpf

Go to the stream folder contained in the folder named "YourFileName"
You are going to drag the contents from the following folders into your customrpf.rpf
-Letters.ytd
-letters.ydr
-required

Open CodeWalker
-Make sure you enable dlc and mods if you have not already then go to options and click "save settings" now close CodeWalker and launch it again
(make sure dlc and mods is still enabled)
-The traditional Vinewood sign should be gone if you did everything correctly
-Press left control and N
-Go to file and open files
-Navigate to the folder named "YourFileName" and go to the ymap folder and open the already set up ymap I set up for you
-Once you open it the letters ABCDEFGH will pop up
-Go to your entities and change the letters to your desired letters, for example if you want to change the A to T then remove aa and input tt
(Position the letters as you wish and make adjustments)
-Save your work
-Stream the entire folder named "YourFileName" to your server (you should have renamed by now)
