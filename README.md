Hello Everyone,

We created this mod so everyone has the chance to have their own custom Vinewood sign made for themselves without having to pay price gouging developers who charge upwards of $80 for one sign. This comes with all files required to make your replacement :slight_smile:
Any questions, I will be happy to answer.

This includes:
Letters A-Z (YDR’s & YTD’s)
Letters are emissive at night
Files required to remove VINEWOOD

Requirements:

OpenIV (https://openiv.com 23)
customrpf.rpf file path in OpenIV (file included if you do not have it set up or do not know how)
CodeWalker ( CodeWalker 55 )

-Open OpenIV
-Enable Edit mod
-Navigate to customrpf.rpf. File Path for this is OpenIV > GTA V > mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks > custompath >dlc.rpf > x64 > levels > gta5 > customrpf.rpf
-Drag & drop all contents in files named “REQUIRED”, “Letters.YTD” & “Letters.YDR” into customrpf.rpf
-Open CodeWalker
-Start new project
-Create new YMAP
-Change LOD distances to 4000 for EACH letter
-Generate manifest for YMAP

To Stream this to your server you are REQUIRED to have the following in your stream folder
-ALL contents contained in file named “REQUIRED”
-ALL letters that you have used, if you made a sign saying “TEST”, you must include the letters T E S T from the YDR & YTD files.
-YMAP you created that will spawn the letters
-Manifest for your YMAP

DO NOT RE-UPLOAD OR USE THIS MOD FOR PAID WORK. THIS IS A FREE RESOURCE FOR ALL
