Hello,

The assets included here contain everything you need to remove the traditional Vinewood sign in your FiveM server or in Singleplayer and make your own custom sign.

Contents:
The folder named "LETTERS" contain letters A-Z (Both YDR and YTD) 
The folder named "LOGO BRACE" is just something simple I made using vanilla props that you can alter yourself, most will not find it useful
The folder named "PRE-MADE FOLDERS" contains two examples of what you need to get started
The folder named "REMOVE ALL FRAMES" contains the ymaps necessary if you want to remove the vanilla "braces"
The folder named "REQUIRED" contains the what you need at bare minimum 

Disclaimer:

This how to is under the assumption that you know the basics of CodeWalker and OpenIV

How to use ?

Open OpenIV 
-Enable Edit mod -Navigate to customrpf.rpf. File Path for this is OpenIV > GTA V > mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks > custompath >dlc.rpf > x64 > levels > gta5 > customrpf.rpf 
-Drag & drop all contents in files named “REQUIRED”, “Letters.YTD” & “Letters.YDR” into customrpf.rpf 
-Open CodeWalker -Start new project -Create new YMAP -Change LOD distances to 4000 for EACH letter -Generate manifest for YMAP

To Stream this to your server you are REQUIRED to have the following in your stream folder
